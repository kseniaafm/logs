# My Logs for the DSSF Program 

## May 30th 2023

I think the reading and interacting with my group members went well. The computer portion is definetely more challanging than I expected it to be. I think I just need to explore more of these resources on my own time which would help me with being more comfortable with the compsci side of this. This is definetely making me more interested in comspsci and web design. I think I have more questions about markdown and vs code, so far i think they look the same but apparently they are not the same thing. Maybe I will look into it myself. 

also I made this timeline with my partners Sky and Bushra.

Today we had the meeting with Jose about the history or more the pop culture and worldwide impacts of the Chernobyl catastrophe. I think that it was very helpful for the team to learn more about the background especially the different ways it was shown in the media. 

Notes I remember from the presentation:
- Stalker (Tarkovsky) was based on Picnic on the Cliff
- Hyperobjects by Timothy Morton(a hyperobject is a philosophical term which encompasses something that surrounds us yet we cannot see it but it is everywhere like climate change or radiation)
- The Chernobyl Herbarium: Fragments of an Exploded Consciousness, a book on how chernobyl impacted people with pictures of radioactive -flowers from the zone
- The Bronze Horseman(Pushkin)
- On saturday(russian film)

Some ideas for project:
1. a model map of places which can have a power plant put in(find patterns and predict locations, for personal effect like oh this can happen to you)
2. effects on medicine and radiation poisoning, how medicine became less stigmatizes and more inclusive
3. compare it to other nuclear disasters such as the precursor of Leningrad and the Pennsylvania one(3 mile island)
4. how nuclear weapons can be used as scare tactics during the current war, and how taking over a NPP can be used to scare others and is a tactical war move
5. how the timing of the chernobyl accident(late 80s) was a deciding factor in whether or not the soviet union stays intact(Gorbachev wanted westernization)
6. the corruption in the government and how the iron curtain may have contributed to the chernobyl accident 
7. how design is a crucial part of the accident and perhaphs how it could be impacted the results(perhaps as a positive note? like oh this could have been prevented and here is how)
8. chernobyl in ao3???

I liked the project management workshop but it definetely could have been shorter, but thats okay. I don't think I have any questions considering that the project still does not have a finalized theme. I wanna work more on the compsci and web design aspect of this, i think it would be fun.

Today we spent sometime in the makerspace in order to get accostomed with different materials and techniques. We also spent some time working with the adobe illustrator. I think its pretty hard right now but I am sure that I will get the hang of it really soon. Maybe I will practice by myself at home later tonight. I was able to design one sticker on my own, a black bunny with "ksusha ksu" written on it in orange. Its a bunny because of the bunny nose and ksusha ksu is my nickname with orange being my favorite color. I was also able to sneak in a princess diana sticker on there which is now on my laptop so that is a win in my books. All of the new machines, 3d printing and vinyl and the embroidery machines are complicated for me to use right now, which is fine. I think im not the only one that is confused. 
I am sure I just need more practice with them and then I will get the hang of it. I think my adobe illustating went well though, I am proud of my work.  I am interested to see how else are we going to use these machines in order to complete this project other than the woodworking room, but I am sure we will be able to if we wanted.
